Hello everyone, I'm X XX from xxx program team, I'm currently working FRTB projet, and I'm excited to take this opportunity to present an overview of our FRTB project to our senior leadership team from Toronto and our colleagues in Halifax Hub, highlighting the key milestones we have reached and the significant achievements of our team.

As we know, FRTB, its full name is The Fundamental Review of the Trading Book, our FRTB project is a crucial initiative for our bank, as it aligns with global regulatory frameworks to strengthen market risk management. This project is essential due to several key reasons,such as Compliance with Basel III Regulations,Risk Management Enhancement,Improved Capital Efficiency,Enhanced Decision Making, Global Consistency, etc.

As a developer in the FRTB Dev team, I would like to provide you with a comprehensive overview of our project from development perspective. I will walk you through the business flow, introduce the architecture of our application, and show you the technologies we have employed.

fisrt of all, let's see the business flow of our FRTB Project. This slide outlines the key processes involved in our workflow.


From this diagram, we can see that the FRTB application takes EODC data as input. The EODC data includes trading positions from 55 feeds and multiple market regions, These data encompass all trading products, including equities, futures, options, and bonds. Each day, we process a significant volume of data, reaching up to 100 million records.

Additionally, the FRTB application uses reference data as input. This reference data contains background information for the trading data, such as security data,market data, book data, an example is rating provided by institutions. 

Our FRTB Application is structured into three main phases:
data enrichment, SA Calculating and Reporting service
FRTB application uses ETL and enrichment processes to Extract,Transform and Load these data, combine the position data and corresponding reference data, make them suitable for the next step
and then we will apply the standardized approaches (SA) for risk assessment and measurement.Standardized approaches come from the Basel III measures. This ensures compliance with regulatory capital requirements.
The FRTB application also provides a reporting service, for generating specific reports to regulators and internal auditors.

in the last part of the flow, regulators and internal auditor will receive SA Reports, which support multiple frequencies such as daily, weekly, and monthly. By default, the FRTB application generates daily SA Reports. 
Additionally, for the data processed by the FRTB application, they are stored in the hot storage and cold stroges,and can be accessed and used by other internal data consumers in the company for various purposes.

In summary, our FRTB Project efficiently processes large volumes of trading data, enriches it, applies standardized risk assessment approaches, and generates comprehensive reports for regulators, auditors, and provides the processed risk data for internal data consumers.

This slide provides a more detailed breakdown of the FRTB system's architecture and data flow, expanding on what we discussed earlier. Here, you can see how we have structured the FRTB project into three distinct phases, each supported by a dedicated component.

Firstly, we have the **Risk Data Layer**. This component handles the crucial tasks of data extraction, transformation, and enrichment, ensuring that the raw trading data is fully prepared for further analysis.

Next is the **SA Calculator**. This component is the core of our risk computation, implementing the Standardized Approach (SBA), Default Risk Charge (DRC), and Residual Risk Add-On (RRAO) methods in accordance with Basel III regulations. It calculates the risk capital charge for the trading book, providing precise and compliant risk assessments.

Lastly, the **Reporting Service** component. This part of the system is responsible for generating the SA Reports. It ensures that we can deliver comprehensive and accurate reports to meet regulatory requirements.

Together, these three components empower the FRTB application to process over 100 million trade records and produce detailed risk reports for the trading book. This robust system architecture not only meets regulatory demands but also significantly enhances our internal risk management capabilities.

This diagram showcases the technology stack currently used in our project. The input data for the FRTB project and the enriched data generated by the risk data layer components are primarily stored in a data lake for hot storage. For cold storage, we use Data Glacier solutions like S3, Dell ECS, and IBM COS to store historical data (e.g., data older than two years). Configuration data for FRTB is stored in an SQL server.

In the messaging layer, we primarily use SNS to receive notifications from upstream systems indicating that feed data is ready. When the FRTB processing is complete, we also send SNS notifications to downstream systems.

In the data ETL and computation layer, due to the large volume of data, we primarily use an on-premise Spark cluster for data computation. We submit daily data ETL and SA Capital Charge computation tasks to the cluster using Java and Scala. I know we have plans to migrate our on-premise applications to the public cloud, but I'm not sure about the exact dates. Currently, we are conducting some technical validation work.
After the computation, we use Dremio to accelerate data query and analysis. Additionally, we use Spring Boot and Swagger to provide interfaces and services to users and data consumers.

Finally, for data analysis and visualization, we use RISK Core, Fabric, and Tableau as the primary tools. 

For DevOps, we mainly use JIRA for project management, GitHub for source code management, Jenkins for build creation, and UCD for application deployment.

that's pretty much the technologies used in our project.

this slide presents the upcoming work of our project in Fiscal Year 24, we will focus on two main areas: Business Enhancement and Technology Evolution.

for Business Enhancement
we are aiming to expand our regulatory reporting to include additional authorities. Currently, we are compliant with OSFI in Canada, but moving forward, we will also target compliance with the regulators in the UK and the US. This expansion ensures that we meet the regulatory requirements in key financial markets, strengthening our global compliance framework.

for Technology Evolving
On the technology front, we have several key initiatives to ensure our systems remain cutting-edge and efficient:

CDP and Spark Upgrade: We plan to upgrade our CDP and Spark platforms alongside an upgrade to our DNA cluster. This will enhance our data processing capabilities and improve overall system performance.

Architectural Restructure and Performance Optimization: In response to changes in the FED methodology, we are restructuring our architecture and optimizing performance. This will ensure our systems are robust and can handle the increased complexity and volume of data processing required.

Microsoft Azure: We are also conducting a Proof of Concept for migrating our on-premise application to Microsoft Azure. This will allow us to explore the benefits of cloud computing, including scalability, flexibility, and cost-efficiency.


In summary, our focus for FY24 is on expanding our regulatory compliance footprint,providing continuous production support and evolving our technology to meet future demands. These steps will ensure we are well-prepared for the challenges ahead and can continue to deliver exceptional value to our stakeholders.
