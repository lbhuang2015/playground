1. FCS Optimization

Work has been completed; documentation details are pending refinement.

2. EDOC Flow Optimization

The main focus is on optimizing SOPHIS_NA, as its feed accounts for over 95% of the total data volume across all feeds.

DRC

Current progress:
Technical optimization has been completed with no impact on output results. In the dev environment, the DRC loading time for SOPHIS_NA has been reduced from 2.5–3 hours to 1.5–2 hours. Considering that the prod environment has 80 executors (each with 64 GB memory, compared to 65 executors × 48 GB in dev), we expect even shorter loading times in production.

Current issue:
The position data for SOPHIS_NA increases by about 5% every two months. Most of the newly added records have a positionquantity value of 0, yet these records still go through the entire DRC enrichment process and are written into the output table.
If we filter out records where positionquantity = 0 when loading position data from the MH90 table, the DRC loading time could be further reduced from 1.5–2 hours to around 1 hour.
To maintain flexibility, users will be allowed to decide whether to enable this filter. A new field, SOPHIS_NA_POSITIONQUANTITY_ZERO_FILTER, will be added to the config table DRC_USER_PREFERED_DATA.

Setting the field value to "Y" enables the filter.

Setting it to "N" disables it.

This approach requires discussion and confirmation with end users.

SBA

The current SBA loading time is 3.5–5 hours, and optimization is feasible. Preliminary analysis suggests it can likely be reduced to under 2 hours.

RRAO

The RRAO loading time is typically around 1 hour, but may reach 2 hours during periods of high cluster resource usage. Optimization is not currently planned for this component.
