Leadership Model Behaviours
Drive to Impact

Articulate a clear path through uncertainty
• When modernizing the FCS and EODC workflows, evaluated multiple Spark optimization strategies—partitioning, caching, and resource parallelization—and established a clear, data-driven execution roadmap that minimized risk while ensuring SLA compliance.

Act with speed and simplicity
• Rapidly refactored FCS enrichment logic to remove redundant computation and streamline job dependencies, cutting runtime from 7 hours to 2.5 hours while simplifying pipeline maintenance and accelerating troubleshooting cycles.

Focus resources on what matters most
• Concentrated efforts on optimizing the most resource-intensive datasets (FCS and SOPHIS_NA) that accounted for the majority of system workload, delivering over 60% runtime reduction and saving approximately CAD 90K in annual compute costs.

Adapt Quickly, Always Learn

Innovate with curiosity and purpose
• Explored and applied advanced Spark techniques—such as targeted persistence, cache management, and lineage breaking—to reduce redundant computation and improve EODC data enrichment efficiency by more than 50%.

Experiment with a passion for learning
• Performed in-depth Spark performance profiling and shared insights on data lineage optimization and distributed execution tuning, enabling the team to adopt a more analytical and performance-aware development mindset.

Demonstrate flexibility
• Adapted quickly to complex challenges during cross-system framework upgrades (Tomcat, Spring, Spark), resolving compatibility issues and ensuring uninterrupted production performance across multiple regional environments.

Unlock the Potential of Our People

Inspire with humility, empathy, and inclusivity
• Created an open, collaborative environment that encouraged new developers to seek guidance and share ideas, fostering confidence and accelerating their integration into the RDL and EGL teams.

Empower and coach to help others be their best
• Mentored new hires through structured code walkthroughs, design reviews, and pair programming, enabling them to independently deliver EGL feature enhancements on time, while strengthening overall team capability.

Hold ourselves and others accountable
• Maintained strong ownership and delivery discipline, ensuring all upgrade, optimization, and production rollout tasks were completed ahead of schedule and with exceptional quality.

Speak Up for the Good of Company

Debate with passion and act as one team
• Proactively contributed to design and architectural discussions on Spark pipeline restructuring, ensuring performance decisions aligned with business goals and operational priorities.

Seek and include diverse perspectives
• Partnered with QA, RTB, and infrastructure teams to validate proposed optimizations and release procedures, promoting knowledge sharing and ensuring consistent delivery quality across the organization.

Have the courage to challenge the status quo
• Challenged the existing data model by flattening hierarchical tree structures into tabular form, resolving severe data skew issues, and introducing a hybrid loop-and-join Spark solution to replace inefficient single-record tree traversal—greatly enhancing processing performance and scalability.
